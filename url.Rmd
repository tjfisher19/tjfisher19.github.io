I regularly work with undergraduate students on independent study research projects.
Many of these projects entail students competing in the Data Expo (a data analysis competition) at the Joint Statistics Meetings however students may perform or assist in the analysis of a collaborative project.

I am also very involved in the local <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/">DataFest</a> competition hosted by the <a href="https://miamioh.edu/cads/index.html">Center for Analytics & Data Science</a> at Miami University. I have organized the competition, contribute to the data distribution and have mentored many teams over the years.

We have been quite successful over the years in the various competitions, if interested in participating feel free to contact me or one of the current/former students working in the lab. Generally, we recruit students after they have completed foundational work (at least STA 363) but with more advanced courses you can make stronger contributions.
